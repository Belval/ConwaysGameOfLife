# ConwaysGameOfLife
An implementation of Conway's game of life in Rust using glium

![Experiment](image.png "Experiment")

The square in the middle can be moved using the arrow keys but I'd recommand disabling the cells otherwise you get about 1 fps.

## You should know
This is mostly an experimentation with the amazing glium OpenGL wrapper by Tomaka and also the first thing I made in Rust. The actual "Conway's game of life" part shows strange behavior but the real goal was to draw stuff on a frame and it works.
